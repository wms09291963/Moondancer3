## Inspiration for the website



I grew up on a residential lake as a kid. I think I was boating before I was driving. Boating has always been a part of my life, and has created many fond memories with friends and family. I've always enjoyed fishing, snorkeling, and swimming off the boat, as well as sharing the experience with others. For some time now I have toyed with the idea of starting my own charter service. Well, the time has come! I've taken the plunge! I've filed the LLC (Limited Liability Company) business entity with the State of Florida, requested a TIN (tax identification number from the IRS), and in the process of obtaining all the required business licenses. And of course, I will need a website! The website will be used to market the charter service, and allow potential customers the ability to "ask the Captain" any questions they may have. Customers will have the abitity to create secure accounts where they can manage their bookings and payments online. Moondancer Charters will be a good complement to my software engineering career. When the charter guests step off the boat, I go down in the cabin and start coding!

## How to use/start the APP

To start the app navigate to the github repository at the following link: https://github.com/AliPort/MoonDancer.git
Either fork or clone to local machine. Start a code editor such as vsc and open a terminal. Run npm install, and npm start. The project should then be running on localhost:3000.

## Navigating through the App

Potential customers will first land on the Home Page. A navigation bar at the top will allow them to click between "Home", "About", "Charters & Tours", and "Fish Index". By clicking through the pages potential customers should gain an idea of the charter service, the tours available, and ultimately create an account and book a tour. Users will create a secure account in order to select and manage/pay for a specific tour. Stripe is used for payment services and is connected to the charter service bank account.

## Outstanding functionality and/or issues

Secure User login/account creation is still a work in process. 
Linking App to Stripe Payment services is still a work in process.
Testing Stripe still a work in process.  
Calendar functions will need review and testing.
